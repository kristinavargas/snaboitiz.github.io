SN Aboitiz Power-Benguet celebrated Earth Day on April 22 with a clean-up drive around the Ambuklao Hydoelectric Power Plant in Bokod, Benguet. A total of 38 employees from SNAP-Benguet’s Ambuklao and Binga plants participated in the clean-up drive, led by SNAP’s Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Joseph Yu (second row, left). Residents, members of the LGUs, and employees of the National Power Corporation also joined the activity. The clean-up drive is held each year during Earth Day as part of SNAP’s environmental initiatives.
