Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Alfonso Cusi led the 10th anniversary celebration of SN Aboitiz Power-Magat, Inc. on April 26, 2017 in Ramon, Isabela. 


In his keynote address, Secretary Cusi noted that the country sources 32% of its power from renewable energy, which is relatively higher than most countries in Asia. Though he wants this to continue, Secretary Cusi also stressed that the DOE adopted a "technology-neutral" policy toward power to increase supply and make prices more reasonable.
