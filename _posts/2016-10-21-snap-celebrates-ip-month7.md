SN Aboitiz Power-Magat, Inc. (SNAP-Magat), together with the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) and the local government of Aguinaldo marked Indigenous Peoples month with a tree-planting activity in Barangay Halag on October 11. Officials of SNAP, NCIP, Aguinaldo LGU, and the Department of Education planted 30 narra seedlings at the compound of Halag Elementary School and Halag National High School. Chief Operating Officer Joseph Yu led SNAP-Magat, while Provincial Officer Esther Lichnachan represented NCIP and Mayor Gaspar Chilagan represented Aguinaldo LGU. The tree-planting activity was held following the public hearing on the Alimit hydropower complex project, which was attended by different barangays and IP organizations in the municipality of Aguinaldo.
