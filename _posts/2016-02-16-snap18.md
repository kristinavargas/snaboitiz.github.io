SN Aboitiz Power-Magat, represented by Community Relations Sr. Supervisor Veronica Adsuara, turned over a dump truck on February 9 to officials of barangay Tupaya in Lagawe, Ifugao, headed by barangay captain Joey Anghad. The donation was made through the Department of Energy’s ER 1-94 and SNAP-Magat’s CSR program. The truck is multi-purpose in nature, meant to haul harvest from farm to market, as well as a service vehicle and ambulance in case of emergency. Community members and people’s organizations representatives noted that a lot of the barangay’s projects come from their development fund and SNAP’s CSR program.


SNAP-Magat is a joint venture between SN Power and AboitizPower. It owns and operates the 360-MW Magat Hydroelectric Power Plant at the border of Isabela and Ifugao.
