The province of Isabela declared July 10 as a non-working holiday to celebrate Disaster Preparedness Day. The province-wide activity called “Todas Dengue, To Na’to” was joined by SN Aboitiz Power-Magat (SNAP-Magat) employees in support of the provincial government, which called for full public participation in the clean-up drive and bloodletting activities.


A total of 65 SNAP-Magat employees headed by AVP and Plant Manager Willy Ferrer, Operations Manager Ed Bundalian, and SHESQ Manager Eliseo Ingles joined members of Brgy. Gen. Aguinaldo in the clean-up operations. The team collected thirty large trash bags of plastic and other non-biodegradable materials along barangay roads and canals. 


SNAP-Magat is a joint venture between SN Power and AboitizPower. It owns and operates the 360-megawatt Magat Hydroelectric Power Plant at the border of Isabela and Ifugao. #
