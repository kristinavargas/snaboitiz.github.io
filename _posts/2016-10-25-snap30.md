SN Aboitiz Power-Benguet (SNAP-Benguet) sponsored a two-day training course on water rescue awareness on October 4 and 5 for volunteer rescue workers, including residents of barangays Ambuklao and Tinongdan, members of the Philippine National Police-Bokod, and SNAP-Benguet employees and contractors.


This is the second year SNAP has sponsored the water rescue awareness training facilitated by the Emergency Research Center, a non-government organization that specializes in emergency preparedness, management, and education. Led by directors Louie Domingo and Aaron Flynn, participants spent two days learning about safety measures when working near water and the use of basic water equipment. The program also included practical exercises on how to manage water-related injuries and save casualties from the water. 
 
 
The annual training is conducted to better equip communities located near the Agno river on emergency preparedness and management.
