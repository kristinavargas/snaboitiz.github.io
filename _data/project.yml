- title: "Dependable Agriculture and Livelihood through Optimized Water Use Yearlong in Magat (DALOY Magat)"
  description: "A project of SNAP-Magat, the National Irrigation Administration (NIA), Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR), and the Council of Irrigators Association, this aims to secure the productivity of farmlands and fishpond operations despite climate change’s impact on water supply through promotion of optimum water use and agricultural techniques to help them sustain their operations and mitigate the impact of water shortage. Initial studies on water sustainability in the target areas showed that most of the water releases become excess consumption of water resulting from 24/7 flows to fishponds. A total of 239 gate valves of various sizes were installed at the South High and Oscariz Main Canals of the dam as of yearend 2012. The gates valves were provided to regulate water flow from the dam via canals to about 400 hectares of fishponds in Ramon and Cordon in Isabela, without compromising water requirements of the fishponds. Fish farmers also attended orientation sessions and training on fishpond management."
