        <p class="service-text">SNAP’s Watershed Management Project aims to alleviate the rapid degradation of natural resources, including soil degradation. We have also partnered with other organizations on environmental initiatives such as the Aboitiz Passion for Agroforestry and Reforestation to Keep (APARK), McConnell Dowell Reforestation Project and the SNAP-Benguet-NPC Technical Cooperation program. APARK aims to restore forest cover by planting fruit- bearing trees and forest trees within the vicinity of the watershed in cooperation with the local people. MCD Reforestation Project has planted 10,000 seedlings within the watershed. SNAP-Benguet’s technical cooperation with NPC protects areas adjacent to the reservoir through the establishment of firelines and patrolling.</p>
