    <p class="section-description">Built in 1960, the Binga Hydroelectric Power Plant lies 19 kilometers downstream of Ambuklao. SNAP won the public bid for Binga and its neighboring power facility Ambuklao in 2007, which were sold as a package under the power sector privatization program of the Philippine government. Only the power components were privatized while the dams remain government-owned.</p>
