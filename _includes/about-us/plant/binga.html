    <p class="section-description">The Binga Hydroelectric Power Plant was built in 1960 and  lies 19 kilometers downstream of its sister facility,  Ambuklao. SNAP won the public bid for Binga and Ambuklao, which were sold as a package under the power sector privatization program of the Philippine government, in 2007 for US$325 million. Only the power components were privatized while the dams remain government-owned.</p>
