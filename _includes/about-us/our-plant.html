        <h2 class="plant-title">MAGAT Plant</h2>
        <p class="plant-text">SN Aboitiz Power-Magat, Inc. is a joint venture between SN Power and AboitizPower. It owns
            and operates the 360-megawatt Magat Hydroelectric Power Plant located at the border of Ramon, Isabela and
            Alfonso Lista, Ifugao.</p>
        <p class="plant-text">Magat was a government-owned plant until it was subject to privatization on 14 December
            2006. SNAP-Magat successfully bid for the plant and took over on 26 April 2007.</p>
        <p class="plant-text">Though used for power generation and flood control, Magat dam’s primary purpose is to
            irrigate about 85,000 hectares of agricultural lands. Only the power components were privatized; the dam and its
            re-regulating facilities are owned, maintained, and operated by the government though the National Irrigation
            Administration (NIA).</p>
        <p class="plant-text">The power plant uses the same water needed for irrigation, and its water use is dependent on
            NIA’s irrigation diversion requirement. Operating as a peaking plant, Magat has a portion of its output under
            power purchase agreements with electric utilities while the rest is sold to the Wholesale Electricity Spot
            Market. It is capable of providing ancillary services for the stability of the grid.</p>
        <p class="plant-text">In 2014, SNAP completed the rehabilitation of Magat hydro after undergoing half-life
            refurbishment of the plant’s electro-mechanical equipment.</p>
        <p class="plant-text">Magat hydro holds international certifications on occupational health and safety, quality
            and environmental management systems. It has also received recognition for its community relations projects.</p>

        <h2 class="plant-title">AMBUKLAO Plant</h2>
        <p class="plant-text">SN Aboitiz Power-Benguet, Inc. is a joint venture between SN Power and AboitizPower. It owns
            and operates the 105-MW Ambuklao Hydroelectric Power Plant in Brgy. Ambuklao, Bokod in Benguet.</p>
        <p class="plant-text">Ambuklao is one of the oldest power plants in the country and was among the first large
            hydroelectric power plants constructed in the Philippines. Running along the upper portion of the Agno River,
            Ambuklao was constructed for power generation and flood control.</p>
        <p class="plant-text">On November 28, 2007, SNAP-Benguet won the public bid for Ambuklao hydro and its neighboring
            power facility Binga, which were sold as a package under the power sector privatization program of the
            Philippine government. It took over operations on July 10, 2008. Only the power components were privatized while
            the dams remain government-owned.</p>
        <p class="plant-text">Ambuklao was decommissioned in 1999 due to siltation and technical problems resulting from a
            strong earthquake that hit Luzon in 1990. SNAP-Benguet undertook a massive rehabilitation project from 2008 to
            2011, leading to the re-operation of the plant and the upgrading of its capacity from 75 MW to 105 MW.</p>
        <p class="plant-text">It is designed as a peaking plant and is capable of delivering energy and providing
            ancillary services needed to stabilize the grid.</p>
        <p class="plant-text">Ambuklao’s health and safety system is certified under international standards and it has
            also been cited for its community programs.</p>

        <h class="plant-title">BINGA Plant</h>
        <p class="plant-text">SN Aboitiz Power-Benguet, Inc. is a joint venture between SN Power and AboitizPower. It owns
            and operates the 140-MW Binga Hydroelectric Power Plant in Brgy. Tinongdan, Itogon, Benguet.
        </p>
        <p class="plant-text">On November 28, 2007, SNAP-Benguet won the public bid for Binga hydro and its neighboring

        <p class="plant-text">Built in 1956, the Binga facility was constructed for power generation and flood control. It
            lies 19 kilometers downstream of Ambuklao.</p>
        <p class="plant-text">The electricity generated by Binga is traded at the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market. Binga
            is also capable of providing ancillary services necessary for the grid’s stability.</p>
        <p class="plant-text">In 2010, Binga underwent refurbishment to increase its capacity from 100 MW to up to 125 MW.
            The project was completed in July 2013. In 2015, Binga underwent uprating work and increased its capacity to 140
            MW.
