    <p class="content-text">SN Aboitiz Power-Magat, Inc. is a joint venture between SN Power and AboitizPower. It owns and operates the 360-megawatt Magat Hydroelectric Power Plant located at the border of Ramon, Isabela and Alfonso Lista, Ifugao.</p>
    <p class="content-text">Magat was a government-owned plant until it was subject to privatization on 14 December 2006. SNAP-Magat successfully bid for the plant and took over on 26 April 2007.</p>
    <p class="content-text">Though used for power generation and flood control, Magat dam’s primary purpose is to irrigate about 85,000 hectares of agricultural lands. Only the power components were privatized; the dam and its re-regulating facilities are owned, maintained, and operated by the government though the National Irrigation Administration (NIA).</p>
    <p class="content-text">The power plant uses the same water needed for irrigation, and its water use is dependent on NIA’s irrigation diversion requirement. Operating as a peaking plant, Magat has a portion of its output under power purchase agreements with electric utilities while the rest is sold to the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market. It is capable of providing ancillary services for the stability of the grid.</p>
    <p class="content-text">In 2014, SNAP completed the rehabilitation of Magat hydro after undergoing half-life refurbishment of the plant’s electro-mechanical equipment.</p>
    <p class="content-text">Magat hydro holds international certifications on occupational health and safety, quality and environmental management systems. It has also received recognition for its community relations projects.</p>
