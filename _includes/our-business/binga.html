    <p class="content-text">On November 28, 2007, SNAP-Benguet won the public bid for Binga hydro and its neighboring
        power facility Ambuklao, which were sold as a package under the power sector privatization program of the
        Philippine government. It took over operations on July 10, 2008. Only the power components were privatized while
        the dams remain government-owned.

    <p class="content-text">Built in 1956, the Binga facility was constructed for power generation and flood control. It
        lies 19 kilometers downstream of Ambuklao.</p>

        is also capable of providing ancillary services necessary for the gridâ€™s stability.</p>
